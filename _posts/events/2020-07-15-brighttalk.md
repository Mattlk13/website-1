  presenting session: Trusted Substrate as Digital Trust Foundation


  August 11 at 6am EDT 


  Abstract

  Embedded computing in automotive and more generally industrial markets has lacked standards and has been so customized that it made security and OTA very complex topics, both at design and operations times.


  Linaro and its members (silicon vendors, Google, Red Hat...) have been building and assembling technologies into a new certifiable design pattern for embedded computing from automotive to medical and across all industrial markets flavors. As part of those technologies, the Trusted Substrate is the foundational layer that expands hardware root of trust to protect computing, enables digital trust and multi-ownership, allows standardized Firmware OTA, and of course participates in overall trustworthiness.


  The session will present use cases in automotive and smart city markets to illustrate how Trusted Substrate technologies support those scenarios. Product designers will discover how the new design pattern will significantly affect their time to market and cost of operation
